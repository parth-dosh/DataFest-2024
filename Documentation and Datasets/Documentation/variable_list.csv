The time period is considered""brief"" if it is less than 15 minutes. Note that the""idle"" periods are retroactively tagged such that the period will start at the last known engagement activity. For a concrete example: 1. user clicks something; 2. reads one minute; 3. clicks something; 4. leaves, comes back 10 minutes later; 5. clicks something. This user would be considered engaged for 1 minute, then idle for 10 minutes. The caveat to this approach is that if they user read the screen for 5 minutes, then left and came back, they would still be considered idle for all of them. This is likely a rare scenario, and in any event, one we can't detect anyway.",
